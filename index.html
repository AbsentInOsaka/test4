    <p> "As the sun sets...</p>
    <p> I can't stop myself from feeling excited... </P>
    <p> An odd anticipation builds in my chest... </p>
    <p> Soon after the evening began to turn that </p>
    <p> shade of deep blue which reminds the people </p>
    <p> returning home...</P>
    <p> It began gradually.</P>
    <p> where there had been only trees, or streetlights poking</P>
    <p> above the sea, there was light.</p>
    <p> The streelights shone without any practical purpose. </p>
    <p>&ensp;</p>
    <p>Now the lights shone for nothing but the sake of shining </p>
    <p> These northern lights are all that is left of the old people." </p>
